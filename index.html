		<b>Subtlety is key</b><br><br>
		When making a horror game, many people resort to cheap (and often funny) jumpscare galore. Sure, you may crap your pants the 
		first couple of times, but then you just get sick of it. What most people don't realize is that subtle tension can make up
		for all the jumpscares in the world. Raising tension slowly and unpredictably keeps the player on their toes, making them
		jumpy and (more importantly) vulnerable. Terror kicks in and induces panic. Shadows move, corners speak. Combine that with
		a good enemy AI and you've got yourself a success.

		A small patch reducing the default window size back to 640x480 due to screen compatibility issues.
