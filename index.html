		<b>Version 0.1.7.1 released</b><br><br>
		Fixed a bug where pressing both arrow keys resulted in a sine-like rotation. Honestly have no clue how I fixed it.

		<b>Version 0.1.7 released</b><br><br>
		Added camera perspective ahead of schedule. Also added (experimental) external model support (.OBJ). It's very fragile and doesn't support almost anything though.

		<b>Version 0.1.5 released</b><br><br>
		I've added matrix transformations. Next up is camera and perspective.

		A small patch reducing the default window size back to 640x480 due to screen compatibility issues.

	<p class="article">
